Zcash is a decentralized cryptocurrency that shares many properties with Bitcoin. They are both distributed and trustless networks that enable secure, peer-to-peer online transactions while following an economic model of a 21,000,000 unit limit with an emission rate that halves every 4 years. The main difference, albeit far from the only one, is that Zcash supports fully private, untraceable transactions. While Bitcoin's openness broadcasts and records eternally transactions often linked to your identity, Zcash allows users to keep their affairs private.

#### Zcash's Privacy
In August 2010, Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, stated, "If a solution was found, a much better, easier, and more convenient implementation of Bitcoin would be possible" in response to a question about using zero-knowledge proofs to enhance Bitcoin's privacy. These zero-knowledge proofs were explored in a research initiative known as Zerocash, which began in 2013 and ultimately led to the launch of Zcash in 2016.

Zcash implements two types of transactions and addresses, allowing its user to choose the one appropriate for the moment:

- Transparent: These are the same as Bitcoin's. Blockchain records visibly all addresses and amounts involved in the transaction.
- Shielded: These transactions are registered on the blockchain with no traces of the addresses or amounts that were part of them.

// TODO: Add picture of types of transactions

Users can also share "viewing keys" if they want to selectively disclose the contents of a shielded transaction to a party, such as a company, that wishes to provide evidence to a regulator.

Many people mistakenly believe that Bitcoin payments are anonymous simply because pseudonymous addresses are used. However, the reality is that these transactions are permanently recorded. When you buy goods, pay someone, or interact with a business, the involved parties (and anyone monitoring those transactions) can use available tools to connect your addresses across past, present, and future transactions. 

Zcash solves the privacy problem using the most advanced methods available, being at the forefront of these researches without overlooking the other use cases in which you might reveal yourself.

#### Other Differences to Bitcoin
There are several other differences between Zcash and Bitcoin, ranging from technical parameters to behavioral differences. 

Nothing symbolizes this as strong as the existence of a Zcash Network Sustainability Mechanism. The actual name and mechanism details have changed over the years, but not the idea. It is a decentralized reserve of funds created slowly through a small portion of the mining rewards that will be used to fund the protocol's development and research. The idea is to avoid the "free-rider" problem that public goods experience, where no one is incentivized enough to work on it. 

Other protocol differences include shorter block times than Bitcoin (75 seconds vs. 15 minutes) and twice as big blocks (2mb vs. 1mb). This difference alone is not enough to provide Zcash with the capabilities of becoming a network geared towards daily user payments. Still, it does give a smoother user experience in several cases.

The last significant difference I would like to highlight is Zcash's rate of change. Contrary to a more ossified Bitcoin, Zcash still has several bold and ground-breaking initiatives being developed, which will be mentioned later in the document as future cataclysms. Depending on the year you read this article, this section may be heavily outdated—I hope so. 

#### Where has it been so far?
Zcash was launched in 2016, over eight years ago. Since then, it has achieved incredible world-class technical breakthroughs in its mission to bring privacy payments to the world: encrypted transactions became faster to create (40s to ~5s), and their memory requirements were reduced 100x (3GB to 0.03GB), allowing for a rising ecosystem of mobile wallets.

What Zcash has not achieved, however, is material broader (non-enthusiasts) market recognition or an economic return for its supporters. This article argues why this won't be the case in the future, but first, we should see why Zcash's economic performance has historically fallen short until last year.

// TODO: Add a picture of Zcash crashing

First, early views within the community, including some from vocal leaders, minimized the importance of price, often stating, "The market is wrong." While there's merit in prioritizing long-term innovation over short-term speculation, this perspective overlooked a crucial nuance: price can act as a powerful Schelling point, attracting both attention and resources. By deprioritizing it, the project inadvertently limited broader investment interest, creating a feedback loop of diminished sentiment and adoption. Every Bitcoin bull cycle has attracted more users to the network, and Zcash has not been able to replicate this.

Second, the challenges of launching cutting-edge technology were inevitable for an early project like Zcash. The decision to replicate Bitcoin's emission schedule led to high early emission rates, which weighed on market prices. Technical growing pains—such as longer block times, evolving wallet support, and questions about feature completeness—further compounded skepticism around Zcash's real-world usability. Governance debates surrounding the network's funding model also created friction, at times draining the community's energy and hindering collaboration.

Finally, attempts to resist centralization by discouraging specialized mining hardware (ASICs) came with unintended consequences. By favoring GPU mining, Zcash leaned heavily on a hobbyist mining community, whose operators often come with short-term profits and no attachment to the asset. This steady sell pressure weakened the token's price. Ironically, the effort to avoid centralization backfired on the project's economics, as large-scale ASIC miners typically have stronger incentives to hold and protect the assets they've invested in. Today, several of Bitcoin's biggest holders are publicly listed miners.

Together, these factors fed a downward spiral: limited adoption by outside enthusiasts, eroding sentiment, and underwhelming returns for supporters.

These factors, however, are circumstantial, and not permanent. This article is being written in 2025, while Zcash Community has never been more active, and privacy is more important than ever. Signs of change are emerging, suggesting that the future for Zcash is no longer just a possibility, but a story in the making.


### The Bullish Case
The bullish case for any asset is the culmination of several cataclysms coming together in a period of high adoption and a market opportunity to seize from. Zcash may finally be poisoned to benefit from this trifecta, with several already in-motion.

#### From Regulatory Uncertainty to Institutional Adoption
Since Zcash's creation, crypto assets have gone through several battles around the world to obtain legitimacy. Those have pinnacled in a resounding victory with the newly elected US president, Donald Trump, tying the success of his term to Bitcoin's price and the recent record-breaking adoption of Bitcoin ETFs and other instruments by Wall Street. 

Once at risk of being banned, marginalized, or excluded from the World's Financial System, Crypto is now being discussed by every wealth advisor in the world, central bank and several public companies. Zcash historically has always been an amplified risk due to its privacy capabilities, especially at times when all crypto's liquidity was concentrated on cryptocurrency exchanges trying to avoid too much regulatory scrutinity. 

It's a continuous humanity achievement that Zcash has not stood still in this regard compared to Bitcoin. The coin has continued to defend its position as supporting the US's fourth amendment, engaging actively with regulators all over the world, especially in Washington, DC. The recently hosted DC Privacy Summit, an event focused on "the intersection of decentralized networks, advanced cryptography, and the law," which was sponsored by Coinbase, counted with the presence of multiple lawmakers, White House staff, and industry players. In its agenda, Zcash is mentioned, with presentations from Zooko Wilcox, one of Zcash's founders, and Josh Swihart, CEO of the Electric Coin Company.

The Electric Coin Company has launched and supported the development of Zcash since 2016, being one of the entities funded by the Zcash Network Sustainability Fund. Paul Brigner, one of the event's organizers and then Head of Coinbase Insitute, has since re-joined ECC as Vice President of Strategic Alliances, where he is expected to solidify Zcash's institutional position with the government and companies.

Zcash continues to be listed and supported by Coinbase, the biggest and most connected US-regulated crypto exchange, with its ZEC/USD volume growing doubling between 2024 H2 and 2023H2. Zcash is also available as a financial instrument through ZCSH, a Grayscale Fund that currently holds 394k (U$22 million) and also saw its volume soar over 300% between 2023 and 2024. 

#### Entering Economic Stability and Great Promises Ahead
The volume (and, in turn, interest) rise in Zcash in the second half of 2024 is not by chance. Despite all the expectations we will see here, one of them has been expected since its launch: Zcash's second halving. 

![](/assets/png/zcash-emission.png)

Like Bitcoin, Zcash began its first year with an annualized inflation rate of 48%. During the first halving, after 4 years of life, the pace of inflation dropped from 25%/yr to 12.5%/yr. In November 2024, the second one of these events happened, further lowering the 8.3%/yr to the current 4.2%/yr - the same inflation US has experienced in the previous year.

This signanficatly lowers the dillution of existing holders, and the ability for newly mined coins to impact the network price once they hit the market, as we discussed above. The next one, in 2028, is set to take Zcash's emission curve below 2.7%. 

This is not the only significant development towards Zcash's economic model. Shielded Labs, a recently created US company, which boosts the already mentioned Zooko Wilcox as one of its members, has started developing the first implementation of "Crosslink", a mechanism that would allow transitioning Zcash to a hybrid PoS, before a full switch. Proof-of-Stake would potentially bring a multitude of benefits, with the two crucial ones to highlight is the reduction of mining costs (and, in turn, the selling pressure that comes with it) and the ability for average Zcash holders to participate in the network consensus and capture the new emissions through staking. 

#### Ecosystem Maturity
The growing pains that have previously haunted Zcash so far have finally started to show results. Much more besides technical advancements already mentioned, Zcash has now a wave of user-impacting releases in progress. 

After several years of trying to work with older hardware wallet providers (Trezor and Ledger: shame on you) to bring the capability for its users to store ZEC privately, with the convenience and the security of these gadgets, it has been Keystone Hardware Wallet that jumped ahead in launching this. Now, long-term investors are able to shield their Zcash holdings without concerns, facilitating usage, storage, and inheritance. 

It gets better. The release of this hardware wallet came integrated with Zashi, a new Zcash Mobile wallet developed by ECC, which is one of the many now stable and existing Zcash wallets present across all platforms. Zashi wallet comes also integrated with Coinbase to allow newcomers to purchase Zcash straight from their mobile using ApplePay/GooglePay and Flexa, allowing them to purchase physical goods in thousands of merchants across the US, Canada, and El Salvador. 

// TODO: Picture of the shielded pool - EOY balance
// 2020: 700,000
// 2021: 824,000
// 2022: 1,000,000
// 2023: 1,280,000
// 2024: 1,970,000

These developments have allowed the expansion of ZECs being stored in shielded, private addresses, with an ever-great pace in the last month of 2024 and probably a bigger one once Keystone is in the hands of more people, or Ledger and Trezor decides to take their user's privacy seriously. Which is doubtful by their constant data breaches.

TODO: Write below sections

- ZEC.JS wallet on the browser, and several mobile wallets and Brave Browser support.
- ZSA's, Swaps, DEXes

#### Zcash's Opportunity

- talk about off-shore, and privacy-needs for bigger players, compaanies and governments
- talk about the future of privacy, and how Zcash is the best way to achieve it


#### Risks in Plain Sights
- list is currently much smaller than it was in 2016, and ever decreasing
- the rise of stablecoins as a privacy-preserving alternative to cash but also crypto
- the re-use of the same privacy-preserving technology in other cryptocurrencies
- a failure execution of DeFi, and the bridge of a stablecoin natively on Zcash.
